my tears ricochet,We gather here
my tears ricochet,We line up weeping in a sunlit room
my tears ricochet,And if I'm on fire
my tears ricochet,"You'll be made of ashes, too"
my tears ricochet,Even on my worst day
my tears ricochet,"Did I deserve, babe"
my tears ricochet,All the hell you gave me?
my tears ricochet,'Cause I loved you
my tears ricochet,I swear I loved you
my tears ricochet,Till my dying day
my tears ricochet,I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
my tears ricochet,And you're the hero flying around saving face
my tears ricochet,And if I'm dead to you why are you at the wake?
my tears ricochet,Cursing my name
my tears ricochet,Wishing I stayed
my tears ricochet,Look at how my tears ricochet
my tears ricochet,We gather stones
my tears ricochet,Never knowing what they'll mean
my tears ricochet,Some to throw
my tears ricochet,Some to make a diamond ring
my tears ricochet,You know I didn't want to
my tears ricochet,Have to haunt you
my tears ricochet,But what a ghostly scene
my tears ricochet,You wear the same jewels
my tears ricochet,That I gave you
my tears ricochet,As you bury me
my tears ricochet,I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
my tears ricochet,"'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave"
my tears ricochet,And if I'm dead to you why are you at the wake?
my tears ricochet,Cursing my name
my tears ricochet,Wishing I'd stayed
my tears ricochet,Look at how my tears ricochet
my tears ricochet,And I can go anywhere I want
my tears ricochet,Anywhere I want
my tears ricochet,Just not home
my tears ricochet,"And you can aim for my heart, go for blood"
my tears ricochet,But you would still miss me in your bones
my tears ricochet,And I still talk to you
my tears ricochet,When I'm screaming at the sky
my tears ricochet,And when you can't sleep at night
my tears ricochet,You hear my stolen lullabies
my tears ricochet,I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
my tears ricochet,And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
my tears ricochet,"You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same"
my tears ricochet,Cursing my name
my tears ricochet,Wishing I stayed
my tears ricochet,You turned into your worst fears
my tears ricochet,And you're tossing out blame
my tears ricochet,Drunk on this pain
my tears ricochet,Crossing out the good years
my tears ricochet,And you're cursing my name
my tears ricochet,Wishing I stayed
my tears ricochet,Look at how my tears ricochet

this is me trying,I've been having a hard time adjusting
this is me trying,"I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting"
this is me trying,I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
this is me trying,I have a lot of regrets about that
this is me trying,Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
this is me trying,Could've followed my fears all the way down
this is me trying,And maybe I don't quite know what to say
this is me trying,But I'm here in your doorway
this is me trying,I just wanted you to know
this is me trying,That this is me trying
this is me trying,I just wanted you to know
this is me trying,That this is me trying
this is me trying,They told me all of my cages were mental
this is me trying,So I got wasted like all my potential

this is me trying,That this is me trying
this is me trying,I just wanted you to know
this is me trying,That this is me trying
this is me trying,At least I'm trying
this is me trying,And it's hard to be at a party
this is me trying,When I feel like an open wound
this is me trying,It's hard to be anywhere these days
this is me trying,When all I want is you
this is me trying,You're a flashback in a film reel
this is me trying,On the one screen in my town
this is me trying,And I just wanted you to know
this is me trying,That this is me trying (Maybe I don't quite know what to say)

illicit affairs,Take the road less traveled by
illicit affairs,Tell yourself you can always stop
illicit affairs,What started in beautiful rooms

illicit affairs,"A dwindling, mercurial high"
illicit affairs,A drug that only worked
illicit affairs,The first few hundred times
illicit affairs,And that's the thing about illicit affairs
illicit affairs,And clandestine meetings

illicit affairs,You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else
illicit affairs,Don't call me kid
illicit affairs,Don't call me baby
illicit affairs,Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
illicit affairs,You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else
illicit affairs,And you know damn well
illicit affairs,For you I would ruin myself
illicit affairs,...a million little times
